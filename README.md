#Eschool

This was a project for our Web Engineering Course.
#Motivation
Our learning become more effective if we learn after we understand that we have some misunderstanding.
So we design this platform such that user can know where is there weakness and what to study to remove that weakness.
#Detailed Aproach
Our system is data centered. We give user some test and try to recognize what that user's weakness. So that we can suggest reading materail according to their weakness.
We think this approach will be very helpful for competitive exam where a single mark can make difference a lot.
So practicing in weakness can be a great advantage.
